There are currently two ways to change server versions on NitroNodes

1. Using the built-in **version changer**
2. Installing them manually.

In this guide. We'll show you how to use the first way.

## Plugin installer

Go to the <a style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }} href="https://control.nitronodes.xyz"> control panel </a> and click your server to manage it.
